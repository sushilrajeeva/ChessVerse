# ChessVerse

**Welcome to ChessVerse!**

ChessVerse is a multiplayer chess platform inspired by Chess.com, where users from around the globe can connect and engage in thrilling chess matches. This repository is my journey into understanding and practicing robust system design principles while building a scalable and feature-rich platform.

The goal of this project is to develop a product that is a subset of Chess.com, gradually incorporating additional features such as authentication, user ratings, and more, as the platform evolves.

## Why ChessVerse?

ChessVerse serves as a hands-on exploration of system design, software engineering, and multiplayer game development. Through this project, I aim to:
- Learn and apply scalable system design principles.
- Build a real-world application that simulates a complex chess platform.
- Experiment with modern technologies and best practices.

## Planned Features

- **Real-Time Multiplayer:** Play chess with friends or random opponents in real-time.
- **Matchmaking System:** Pair players based on skill level and availability.
- **Authentication:** Secure login and user profiles (upcoming).
- **Rating System:** Implement Elo-based rating for competitive play (upcoming).
- **Responsive Design:** A seamless experience across devices.

## Tech Stack

The tech stack will evolve as the project grows, but the focus will be on scalability, performance, and a great user experience.
